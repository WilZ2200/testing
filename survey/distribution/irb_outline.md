## 2. Study Summary

### 2.1 Background and Rationale

Breast cancer screening guidelines vary across organizations (USPSTF, ACS, ACR), and women's preferences play an important role in shared decision-making about screening participation. Understanding the trade-offs women are willing to make between screening attributes (method, frequency, cost, accuracy, discomfort) is essential for designing patient-centered screening programs.

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are an established methodology in health preference research that present respondents with hypothetical scenarios to elicit preferences and estimate the relative importance of different attributes. This study will use a DCE to quantify women's preferences for breast cancer screening program characteristics.

### 2.2 Study Objectives

**Primary objective:** Estimate the relative importance of seven breast cancer screening attributes (method, frequency, cost, sensitivity, false positive rate, wait time, pain/discomfort) in women's screening preferences.

**Secondary objectives:**
1. Calculate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for improvements in each screening attribute
2. Identify preference heterogeneity across demographic and clinical subgroups
3. Estimate predicted uptake rates for different screening program configurations
4. Assess the influence of prior screening experience and risk perception on preferences

### 2.3 Study Design
Cross-sectional, observational survey study using a discrete choice experiment methodology.

## 5. Study Procedures

### 5.1 Overview

Participants complete a single online survey lasting approximately 20-25 minutes. There are no follow-up visits, interventions, or longitudinal components.

### 5.2 Detailed Procedures

1. **Eligibility screening:** Brief screening questions (age, sex) to confirm eligibility
2. **Informed consent:** Electronic informed consent form presented; participants must indicate agreement to proceed
3. **Part A -- Screening background:** 10 questions about prior breast cancer screening experience, family history, and risk factors
4. **Instructions and practice task:** Explanation of DCE format with a practice choice task and comprehension check
5. **Part B -- Choice tasks:** 12 discrete choice tasks, each presenting two hypothetical screening programs and an opt-out option
6. **Part C -- Sociodemographics:** 17 questions covering age, education, income, marital status, employment, insurance, race/ethnicity, health literacy, risk perception, and screening experience
7. **Part D -- Debriefing:** 7 questions about task difficulty, decision strategies, and open-ended feedback
8. **Completion:** Thank you page with breast cancer screening resources; completion code for panel participants

### 5.3 Data Collection

All data collected electronically via Qualtrics survey platform. No paper data collection (except consent forms at clinic sites).

## 6. Risk Assessment

### 6.1 Risk Level
**Minimal risk.** The study involves a survey with no intervention, no clinical procedures, and no collection of sensitive identifiers.

### 6.2 Potential Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Psychological discomfort from cancer-related questions | Low | Mild | Participants informed in consent; skip option for sensitive questions; resource links provided |
| Mental fatigue from choice tasks | Low | Mild | Survey designed for 20-25 min; breaks permitted |
| Loss of confidentiality | Very low | Moderate | No PII collected; encrypted storage; de-identified data; platform IDs deleted post-payment |
| Coercion (clinic recruitment) | Very low | Mild | Voluntary participation emphasized; providers informed not to pressure; no impact on care |

### 6.3 Risk-Benefit Assessment
The risks are minimal and comparable to everyday activities. The study generates knowledge that may benefit future screening program design and health policy.

## 7. Privacy and Confidentiality

### 7.1 Data Collected
- Survey responses (demographics, screening history, choice task selections, debriefing)
- Timing data (time spent on each survey page)
- Platform participant ID (for compensation only; deleted after payment)
- No names, addresses, SSN, medical record numbers, or other HIPAA identifiers

### 7.2 Data Security Measures
- Data stored on Qualtrics (SOC 2 Type II certified, HIPAA compliant)
- Exported data stored on university-managed encrypted servers
- Access restricted to approved research team members (PI + 3 team members)
- Password-protected files; two-factor authentication required
- Platform IDs permanently deleted within 30 days of compensation processing
- De-identified dataset retained for 7 years per institutional policy

### 7.3 Data Sharing
- De-identified dataset may be shared via public repository (e.g., ICPSR, Dryad) upon manuscript publication, consistent with journal and funder requirements
- No individual responses identifiable in any shared dataset
- Data use agreement required for secondary analyses

## 8. Informed Consent

### 8.1 Consent Process

**Online participants:** Electronic informed consent form presented before survey. Participants read the form and click "I agree to participate" to proceed. The consent form is available for download/print.

**Clinic-based participants:** Paper informed consent form provided. Research coordinator available to answer questions. Signed copy retained by research team; participant receives a copy.

### 8.2 Key Consent Elements
- Purpose, procedures, duration
- Voluntary participation; right to withdraw
- Risks and benefits
- Compensation
- Confidentiality protections
- Contact information for PI and IRB
- Statement of consent with signature/click

### 8.3 Consent Form
See attached informed consent form (informed_consent.tex).

### 8.4 Waiver Requests
No waiver of consent requested. All participants provide informed consent.

**Documentation waiver for online participants:** We request a waiver of signed (written) consent for online participants, as the research presents no more than minimal risk and the principal risk is a breach of confidentiality, which a signed consent form would increase. Electronic consent (checkbox) is obtained instead.
